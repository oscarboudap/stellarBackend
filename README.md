# Supernova Simulation - Backend

This is the backend of the Supernova Simulation project, where we simulate and visualize stellar physics and star classifications. It provides an API for simulating stars, calculating light curves, and determining the classification of stars based on their parameters like mass, temperature, and luminosity.
